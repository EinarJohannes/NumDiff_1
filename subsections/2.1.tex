\subsection{Introduction to the Problem}

The goal in this part of the report is to model the spread of an
infectious disease in a population. To do so, the population is
divided into 3 categories, Infected (I), Susceptible (S) and
Recovered (R). The three categories give rise to the
so-called SIR model.

All infected  individuals (I) are sick, and assumed to be infectious
and able to spread the disease to susceptible individuals (S). The
susceptible individuals (S) are healthy individuals who can become
infected. The recovered individuals (R) are individuals who have
recovered from the disease and are immune to it. By assumption, 
an individual who is recovered may also be dead. Soeone who is
recovereed is not able to be infected again.
