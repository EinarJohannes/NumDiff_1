\subsection{A mathematical model of the problem}
Assume first that we only consider the amount of infected
peaple at some location in space, and want to investigate
how the disease affects a number of people at this location.
The SIR-model that only depends on time would then look like
this:

\begin{align}
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta SI, \label{eq:SIR1} \\
  \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta SI - \gamma I, \label{eq:SIR2} \\
  \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I. \label{eq:SIR3}
\end{align}
